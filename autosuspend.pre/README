* put your scripts here that should run pre a suspend
* scripts will be sorted by name, regardless of subdirectory
* any script exiting with an exit status not 0 will cancel the suspend
* every script will receive the interface we listen on as first and only
  argument
* you are free to adapt the following prefix convention:

  * prefixes ``0-99`` for debug purposes
  * prefixes ``100-499`` for checks if we should suspend
  * prefixes ``500-899`` to prepare for the suspend
  * prefixes ``900-999`` for debug purposes

* consider to prefix scripts which are cheap and likely to prevent the
  suspend with lower prefixes
